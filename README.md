generating random scale-free networks using a preferential attachment mechanism in Euclidian Space. 

A BFS (Breadth First Search) algorithm was implemented to calculate the shortest paths in the network in C++, along with the calculation of assortativity by degree using an adaptation of the Pearson coefficient by Newman
